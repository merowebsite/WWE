        WWE has hosted a premium live event “Money in the Bank” on 2nd July which has been a success and so far received a positive response from the audience and the critics. WWE is going to host Summerslam e which is 2 weeks away and ticket sales is not going well as 11000tickets are left for houseful. 
        Top WWE superstars such as Randy Orton, Cody Rhoades, and Big E have been injured also resulting in poor ticket sales for Summerslam.  These injuries have also caused lack of top superstars for its shows, reducing the ratings of its weekly shows. And the WWE undisputed universal champion Roman Regins being absent from weekly shows is also not helping.
